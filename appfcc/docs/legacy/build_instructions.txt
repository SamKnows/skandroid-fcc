To build the file:

1.  Modify local.properties, to have two lines like this (but with the *correct* password!)

key.store.password=This_is_the_password
key.alias.password=This_is_the_password

2. Make sure you've updated the two version numbers in AndroidManifest.xml!

3. Run this from the command-line...

  bash do_make_release.sh

4. Once you've installed and tested RELEASES/xyz/FCC.apk..
   ... you can "git push"...

5. Distribute the .apk file VIA TEST FLIGHT!
